## To Uninstall
Really wish we had a better answer here - but the folks at Oracle do not provide an "uninstall" for SDF Configuration projects
like they do "bundles" - so to uninstall this you need to manually find all Custom Fields, Custom Records, Custom Lists,
Scripts / Script Deployments and manually delete them from your system.
Then you can navigate to SuiteScripts in the file cabinet and delete the directory "HITC Mass Emailer".

## Questions
Head in the Cloud Development, Inc. provides this software under the included license and is the only consulting firm
that you should pay to assist you with this software. That's the point of the license - to make it free to anyone to obtain,
use and modify - for their OWN purposes... if another consulting group or individual is asking to be paid to in any way
modify or assist with this software - they are in violation of the license.
